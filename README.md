# OrangeHRM Automation Project 
Project Overview:
The OrangeHRM Automation Project is developed to test the functionalities of the OrangeHRM application through both manual testing methodologies and Selenium-based automation. By adopting the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, the project ensures maintainability, readability, and scalability of the test scripts.

* Project Structure
  
1. Manual Testing
The manual testing phase involves creating detailed test scenarios and cases to verify application behavior. The documentation includes:

-Prerequisites: Conditions that must be met before testing.
-Test Data: Specific data required for testing scenarios.
-Steps to Execute: Clear instructions for test execution.
-Expected Results: Anticipated behavior or outcome after execution.

2. Automation Testing
The automation framework is built using modern tools and technologies, including:

Java: Programming language for implementing the test scripts.
Selenium WebDriver: A robust browser automation tool.
Page Object Model (POM): A design pattern to separate the test logic from UI element locators for better reusability and maintenance.
TestNG: A test execution framework for organizing, running, and reporting test results.
Maven: A build automation and dependency management tool for efficient project management.
